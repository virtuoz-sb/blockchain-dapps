        Game of Silks, Inc. (“we”, “us” or “our”) is making the Silks derivative gaming platform (the “Platform”)
        available to you. The Platform will leverage a blockchain-enabled metaverse to parallel the real world of
        thoroughbred horse racing and is powered by a play-to-earn (P2E) gaming economy allowing players to reap tokens
        through gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem. By signing up for an account on the site, connecting your

      <p data-renderer-start-pos="2400">
        (i) Wallet Set-Up. To most easily use the Platform, you should first install a web browser (such as the Google
        Chrome web browser). You will also need to use a supported electronic wallet (e.g., MetaMask), which will enable
        you to purchase and store collectibles that you collect or purchase via the Platform. Each collectible is a
        non-fungible token (an “NFT”) on the Ethereum blockchain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p data-renderer-start-pos="2791">
        (ii) Security. You are responsible for the security of your electronic wallets.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p data-renderer-start-pos="2872">
        (iii) Transactions. You can use your electronic wallet to purchase, store, and engage in transactions using one
        or more cryptocurrencies that we may elect to accept from time to time. Transactions that take place on the
        Platform are managed and confirmed via the Ethereum blockchain. You understand that your Ethereum blockchain
        public address will be made publicly visible whenever you engage in a transaction on the Platform.

        <strong> PURCHASING YOUR COLLECTIBLES</strong>
      </p>
      <br />
      <p data-renderer-start-pos="3335">
        (i) Acquiring Collectibles. The Platform allows you to purchase, earn, collect and showcase digital assets that
        represent or relate to the Silks metaverse (each, a “Collectible”).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p data-renderer-start-pos="3516">
        (ii) Purchasing Collectibles. You can purchase Collectibles (a) by buying Collectibles from us on the Platform;
        or (b) by buying Collectibles from other Collectible owners outside of the Platform. If you decide to purchase
        Collectibles outside of the Platform, you understand that such purchases will be entirely at your sole risk.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p data-renderer-start-pos="3849">
        (iii) Characteristics of Collectibles. Each Collectible represents or relates to an aspect of the Silks

      <p data-renderer-start-pos="3999">
        (i) Financial Transactions on Platform. Any payments or financial transactions that you engage in via the
        Platform will be conducted solely through the Ethereum blockchain. We have no control over these payments or
        transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any payments or transactions. We have no liability to you or
        to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any payments or transactions that you
        engage in via the Platform, or any other payment or transactions that you conduct via the Ethereum blockchain.{' '}

      </p>
      <br />
      <p data-renderer-start-pos="4688">
        (ii) Gas Fees. Every transaction on the Ethereum blockchain requires the payment of a transaction fee (each, a
        “Gas Fee”). The Gas Fees fund the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum blockchain. This
        means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that you instigate via the Platform. Except as
        otherwise expressly set forth in these Terms, you will be solely responsible to pay any Gas Fee for any
        transaction that you instigate via the Platform.

      <br />

        governmental authority (collectively, the “Taxes”) associated with your use of the Platform.

        YOUR OWNERSHIP OF COLLECTIBLES WILL ONLY BE RECOGNIZED BY US IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE RIGHTFULLY

      <br />
      <p data-renderer-start-pos="5883">
        “Own” means, with respect to a Collectible, a Collectible that you have purchased or otherwise rightfully
        acquired from a legitimate source (and not through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities (as defined
        below)), where proof of such purchase is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p data-renderer-start-pos="6175">
        (i) Ownership of Collectible. Because each Collectible is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain, when you purchase a
        Collectible in accordance with these Terms (and not through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities), you
        own the underlying NFT. This means that you have the right to swap your Collectible, sell it, or give it away.
        Ownership of the Collectible is mediated entirely by the Ethereum blockchain. Except as otherwise permitted by
        these Terms, such as in cases where we determine that the Collectible has not been rightfully acquired from a
        legitimate source (including, without limitation, through any of the Category B Prohibited Activities), at no
        point will we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Collectible.

        to the Platform Materials other than those expressly contained in these Terms; (b) that you do not have the

        (i) Value and Volatility. The prices of collectible blockchain assets are extremely volatile and subjective and
        collectible blockchain assets have no inherent or intrinsic value. Fluctuations in the price of other digital
        assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your Collectibles, which may also be subject to
        significant price volatility. Each Collectible has no inherent or intrinsic value. We cannot guarantee that any
        Collectibles purchased will retain their original value, as the value of collectibles is inherently subjective
        and factors occurring outside of the Silks ecosystem may materially impact the value and desirability of any
        particular Collectible.

      <br />
      <p data-renderer-start-pos="23616">
        (iii) Use of Blockchain. The Platform does not store, send, or receive Collectibles. This is because
        Collectibles exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Ethereum blockchain. Any transfer of
        Collectibles occurs within the Ethereum blockchain, and not on the Platform.

      <p data-renderer-start-pos="23908">
        (iv) Inherent Risks with Internet Currency. There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency,
        including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious
        software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored
        within your electronic wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication
        failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum blockchain,

      <p data-renderer-start-pos="24473">
        (v) Regulatory Uncertainty. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies and tokens
        is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of the Silks
        ecosystem, and therefore the potential utility or value of your Collectibles.
