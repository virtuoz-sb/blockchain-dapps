              For the sake of completeness, for users residing or domiciled in Saint Vincent, we would like to point out that in the USA
              there are surveillance measures by US authorities which generally allow them to get access to all personal data that has been
              transferred from Saint Vincent to the USA. This is done without differentiation, limitation or exception based on the

              access to and use of such data. In addition, we would like to point out that in the USA there are no legal remedies available
              for the persons concerned from Saint Vincent that would allow them to gain access to the data concerning them and to obtain
              its correction or deletion, or that there is no effective legal protection against general access rights of US authorities. We
              explicitly draw your attention to this legal and factual situation in order to enable an informed decision to consent to the
